# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for bore

## 1. Product Overview
This project aims to develop a lightweight, enterprise-grade alternative to ngrok using Golang. The solution will provide secure tunneling capabilities for exposing local development servers to the internet, with a focus on simplicity, security, and scalability. The architecture consists of a client component that runs on the user's machine and a server component that handles public-facing connections.

## 2. Objectives
- Replace ngrok functionality with a self-hosted, open-source solution
- Ensure enterprise-grade security, reliability, and performance
- Provide a simple command-line interface for developers
- Support HTTPS tunneling with automatic certificate management
- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities
- Enable easy deployment and configuration for enterprise environments

## 3. Target Audience
- Developers needing to expose local services for testing and collaboration
- DevOps teams requiring secure tunneling for CI/CD pipelines
- Enterprises seeking self-hosted alternatives to third-party tunneling services

## 4. Core Features
- Bidirectional TCP/UDP tunneling
- HTTPS support with automatic TLS certificate generation
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Real-time connection monitoring and logging
- Custom domain support
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- RESTful API for tunnel management
- Docker containerization for easy deployment

## 5. Detailed Epics

### Epic 1: Core Tunneling Infrastructure
**Goal:** Establish the fundamental tunneling mechanism between client and server

**User Stories:**
- As a developer, I want to start a tunnel from my local machine to expose port 8080 so that external users can access my development server
- As a server administrator, I want to receive and validate tunnel requests from authenticated clients
- As a system, I need to maintain persistent connections between client and server with automatic reconnection on failure
- As a developer, I want to specify custom subdomains for my tunnels to make them easily identifiable
- As a server, I need to handle multiple concurrent tunnels without performance degradation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Client can establish secure connection to server
- Server can forward incoming requests to correct client tunnel
- Connection remains stable under normal network conditions
- Automatic cleanup of inactive tunnels after timeout
- Support for both TCP and HTTP protocols

### Epic 2: Security and Authentication
**Goal:** Implement enterprise-grade security measures for all tunnel communications

**User Stories:**
- As a security officer, I want all tunnel traffic to be encrypted using TLS 1.3
- As a developer, I need to authenticate my client with the server using API keys or OAuth
- As a server administrator, I want to implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- As a compliance officer, I need audit logs for all tunnel activities
- As a developer, I want to restrict tunnel access to specific IP ranges or user groups

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All communications use end-to-end encryption
- Multi-factor authentication support for client registration
- Comprehensive audit logging with searchable events
- Automatic certificate rotation and renewal
- Integration with enterprise identity providers (LDAP, SAML)

### Epic 3: Management and Monitoring
**Goal:** Provide tools for managing and monitoring tunnel operations

**User Stories:**
- As a DevOps engineer, I want a web dashboard to view active tunnels and their status
- As a developer, I need CLI commands to list, start, and stop tunnels
- As a system administrator, I want Prometheus metrics for monitoring tunnel performance
- As a developer, I need detailed logs for troubleshooting connection issues
- As an enterprise user, I want integration with existing monitoring stacks (ELK, Grafana)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Real-time dashboard showing tunnel status and traffic
- REST API for programmatic tunnel management
- Structured logging with configurable log levels
- Performance metrics collection and export
- Alert system for tunnel failures and anomalies

### Epic 4: Advanced Features and Scalability
**Goal:** Add enterprise features for production deployment

**User Stories:**
- As an enterprise user, I want to deploy the server in a Kubernetes cluster
- As a developer, I need support for custom domains with automatic DNS configuration
- As a system, I need to handle high-traffic loads with horizontal scaling
- As a developer, I want to tunnel UDP traffic for gaming or VoIP applications
- As an enterprise, I need integration with existing security policies and firewalls

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Docker and Kubernetes deployment manifests
- Load balancing support for multiple server instances
- Custom domain validation and SSL certificate provisioning
- UDP tunneling support with NAT traversal
- Compliance with enterprise security standards (SOC 2, GDPR)

### Epic 5: Deployment and Operations
**Goal:** Ensure easy deployment and operational excellence

**User Stories:**
- As a DevOps engineer, I want automated deployment scripts for cloud platforms
- As a system administrator, I need configuration management for different environments
- As a developer, I want pre-built binaries for multiple operating systems
- As an enterprise, I need backup and disaster recovery procedures
- As a maintainer, I want automated testing and CI/CD pipelines

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Terraform modules for cloud deployment
- Configuration files for development, staging, and production
- Cross-platform binary releases
- Database backup and restore procedures
- Comprehensive test coverage with automated pipelines

## 6. Technical Architecture
- **Client Component:** Lightweight Golang binary that establishes outbound connections to server
- **Server Component:** Golang HTTP server handling public connections and tunnel management
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for storing tunnel metadata and user information
- **Caching:** Redis for session management and rate limiting
- **Message Queue:** Optional RabbitMQ for handling high-volume tunnel requests

## 7. Security Considerations
- All sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments
- Compliance with OWASP security guidelines
- Zero-trust architecture with minimal attack surface
- Secure defaults with configurable hardening options

## 8. Success Metrics
- Tunnel establishment success rate > 99.9%
- Average latency < 50ms for tunnel connections
- Support for 1000+ concurrent tunnels per server instance
- Zero security incidents in production deployments
- Adoption by at least 3 enterprise customers within 6 months

## 9. Timeline and Milestones
- Phase 1 (Month 1-2): Core tunneling functionality
- Phase 2 (Month 3): Security and authentication
- Phase 3 (Month 4): Management dashboard
- Phase 4 (Month 5): Advanced features and scalability
- Phase 5 (Month 6): Production deployment and testing

## 10. Risks and Mitigations
- **Network Reliability:** Implement automatic reconnection and failover mechanisms
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Regular code reviews and security testing
- **Performance Bottlenecks:** Load testing and optimization from day one
- **Adoption Challenges:** Provide comprehensive documentation and support

This PRD provides a comprehensive roadmap for building an enterprise-grade ngrok alternative in Golang. The detailed epics ensure thorough planning and implementation of all necessary features for a production-ready solution.
